    <p>My pronouns are <em>she/her/hers</em> and I am a senior studying <strong>Marketing and Management.</strong></p>
    <p>Learning html is very important to me, I know I will use it in the industry that I am going into.</p>
    <p>I know that I could be an asset, whereever I work, as long as I gain the information from this course</p>
    <p>A little bit about myself is, I am the youngest of 4 kids and my family is very important to me. I grew up as a competative dancer</p>
    <p>and gymnast, and I spent the majority of my life outside of <u>Philadelphia Pennsylvania.</u></p>
